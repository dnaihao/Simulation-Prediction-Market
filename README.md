# Running Jupyter-like Python script in Visual Studio Code

Hey folks, I've played around with this amazing VS Code feature a little bit tonight and wrote a example file `map_simulation-jupyter.py`. With the heading `#%%` you can actually specify code cells in VS Code and run the script cell by cell. It also supports exporting to Jupyter Notebook! Feel free to check it out :)
